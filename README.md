Introduction
This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The recommendation system utilizes cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies and recommend those with the highest similarity scores.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of movie ratings provided by Kaggle. It contains information about the movies, users, their ratings, etc.

Algorithm
The recommendation system employs the cosine similarity metric to calculate the similarity between movies. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a measure of similarity between their directions in a multi-dimensional space.

Usage
To use the movie recommendation system:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/anubrat25/Movie-Recommendation-System
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the recommendation system: python recommendation_system.py
Input user preferences or viewing history when prompted.
Get personalized movie recommendations based on cosine similarity.
Results
The recommendation system provides personalized movie recommendations tailored to each user's preferences. Users can explore recommended movies and discover new titles based on their similarity to previously liked movies.
